# Fantasy Projections vs. Actual Points
---
#### Jakob Holcomb and Nick Schnurr

### Introduction

Fantasy football has been a long-standing favorite for millions of fans for the National Football league (NFL). Friends, family, co-workers come together to become owners of their own team, and draft NFL football players. They compete against one another week by week throughout the entire NFL season. NFL players score various points based off catches, yards, and touchdowns scored. These fantasy owners must decide which player they want to start each week. They rely heavily on the projected points of each NFL player. Throughout the year, many of these projections are not accurately depicted in the individual football playersâ€™ actual performance. Our source written by Fantasy Aftermath has taken stats up to date to allow us to be as accurate with our conclusions as possible.

### Analysis

This analysis aims to explore the accuracy of fantasy football projections by comparing them to actual player performance over the course of the season. How accurate is the projected vs actual performance? How do touchdowns impact fantasy points scored? What stats impact fantasy points the most? Who are the top 10 fantasy players and what positions are in the top 10?  We plan to answer all these questions in the report.
